Amreen Khandaker, Justin Garcia-Quinones and Kilmar Rivas collaborated on this project-

This Cakes project demonstrates the fundamentals of Java OOP. 
We used: 
Encapsulation by creating private member variables. 
Inheritance by creating subclasses. 
Polymorphism by overloading and overriding methods.

Justin created the superclass called Cake.
Amreen created subclass of Cake called ChocoCake.
Kilmar created aother subclass of Cake called CrumbCake.
